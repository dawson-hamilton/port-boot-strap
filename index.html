        <p>My name is Dawson Hamilton and I am 20 years old. I live in Murray
            Utah. I used to live with my parents in West Valley with my parents until I moved out.
            I'm currently attending the University of Utah coding boot
            camp trying to learn how to become a computer programmer.
            I attended the American Internation School of Utah and graduated in 2017.
            After highschool I decided to try and get my firefighter certifications and
            passed that with flying colors but decided that I didn't want to be an EMT.
            After that I looked into other things that I was into like music development, soccer, video games...
            I decided to go with computer programming because I took a class in highschool and really enjoyed it.
        </p>

            I currently work at Cracker Barrel as a full time server and hope to
            leave there as soon as possible. In my free time I love to play video games
            like Rainbow Six Siege, Destiny 2, Overwatch... I also love to watch videos
            on Youtube, hang out with my freinds from high school, and play lots and lots of DnD.
            I would really love to become a video game designer when I'm done with this class to
            design a game of my own. A couple fun facts about me is that I am certified to be a
            fire fighter but don't enjoy being a EMT so that is why I am here. Also, I have a daughter
            that was just born Oct. 21st of 2019 and couldn't be happier!
